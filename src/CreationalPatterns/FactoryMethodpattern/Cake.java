/*
What is the Factory Method Pattern?
The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

Real-Life Example
Imagine a cake shop. You can order different types of cakes (chocolate, vanilla, strawberry). The cake shop decides the type of cake to create based on your order. You donâ€™t need to know how the cakes are made; you just place the order.

/*What is the Bridge Pattern?
The Bridge Pattern separates an objectâ€™s abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

Real-Life Example
Think of a remote control (abstraction) that can work with different devices like a TV, DVD player, and
 sound system (implementations). The remote sends commands, but how these commands are executed depends on the device.
